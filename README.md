# Hi, I'm Bartosz 👋

I'm a full-stack developer and Senior Customer Solutions Architect with a passion for building practical tools, clean APIs, and backend systems that make life easier for users and teams.

💡 I love working with:
- **Go** for robust and efficient backend development  
- **TypeScript** across both **frontend** and **backend** (Node.js)  
- **PostgreSQL** for structured, reliable data  
- **APIs** that bring systems together  
- And recently, exploring **AI integrations** in production environments

## 🔧 Projects

### [bzCommerce](https://github.com/bzelaznicki/bzCommerce)
A custom eCommerce platform built with **Go**, **TypeScript**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
It includes product and variant management, nested categories, admin tools, cart sessions, and a cleanly structured frontend.  
Focused on performance, modularity, and developer-first design—think PrestaShop or Magento, reimagined in Go.

## 🧠 Interests

- Applied AI and API-driven ML tools  
- Streaming/OTT platforms and broadcast tech  
- Developer tooling for automation and internal platforms

## 🌍 Languages

- Polish 🇵🇱 (native)  
- English 🇬🇧 (fluent)
